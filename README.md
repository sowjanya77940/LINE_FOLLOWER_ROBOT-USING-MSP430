# LINE_FOLLOWER_ROBOT-USING-MSP430
Line Following is one of the most important aspects of robotics.
A Line Following Robot is an autonomous robot which is able to follow either a black line that is drawn on the surface consisting of a contrasting color. 
It is designed to move automatically and follow the line. 
The robot uses IR sensors placed at the front end to identify the line, thus assisting the robot to stay on the track. 
The sensor makes its movement precise and flexible. 
The robot is driven by the movement of the wheels. 
The controller based on the Texas Instruments MSP430G2553 interface is used to perform and implement algorithms to control the speed of the motors, steering the robot to travel along the linesmoothly. 
This project aims to implement the algorithm and control the movement of the robot by proper tuning of the control parameters and thus achieve better performance and to give fast, smooth, accurate and safe movement. 
It can be used industrial automated equipment carriers, small household applications, tour guides in museums and other similar applications, etc.
Key words:Line following robot, IR sensor, Precise, Control of movement, Flexible, Accurate, Safe movement, Applications.
